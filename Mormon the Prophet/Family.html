    <p id="par">In 1823 a young boy of age 17 had many visits from an Angel of the Lord. This was something that the boy was
        accustomed too after his first vision in 1820. The boy was named Joseph Smith Jr. and he "saw a pillar of light
        exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.

“… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. 
One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17)."
    </p>
    <p>This first vision was very important as well as the 1823 angel visitation because it led way to the translation of the Book of Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Book of Mormon contains the word of god, and the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are told through first hand accounts of ancient prophet, seers, and revelators.
        These prophets include Nephi, Alma, Moroni, etc.
    </p>
    <p>However, there was one prophet among them that has contributed to the Book of Mormon, not in terms of prophetic visions or stories of baptisms. This prophet was named 
        Mormon, from what the book is titled.
        </p>
        <p>According to the intorduction of the Book of Mormon, the prophet Mormon was not only a prophet but a historian. He was able to help keep records and redacted a couple of things in the
            scriptures. He was able to abridge the many years of ancient Nephite and Lamanite history and was able to give to us the important things that the Lord wanted the people
            of today to learn.
            "3 And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, 
            of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, 
            from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi"(Words of Mormon 1:3).

            <div class="question">Chronology of Mormon's Life:</div>
               <div> Born: Around A.D. 311 
                    <p>10 years old: Met Ammaron and was given responsibility of being in charge of the records.</p>
                    <p>15 years old: Was visited by the Lord and had a testamony of Him</p>
                    <p>16 years old: Appointed Military leader of the Nephites and led many battles</p>
                    <p>24 years old: Began keeping the record of the Nephite people.</p>
                    <p>51 years old: Mormon's people wanted to destroy the Lamanites but he refused too.</p>
                    <p>74 years old: Gathered people to Hill Cumorah and gave his son, Moroni, responsibilty over plates.</p>
                    <p>Around 75 years old was killed by Lamanites.</p>
                    <p>While the Book of Mormon had many miracles and stories about the goodness of the Lord and His wrath, Mormon had an impact on me. 
                    When I was studying the Book of Mormon, I saw that the many things that Lord wanted me to read about, it was Mormon who had the inspiration to put them in. 
                    He was in charge of the hundreds of years of his peoples history and took out the things in which he found precious and was inspired of God to do so.

            <div>Filipino</div>
    <div class="question">Does your family do ‘family home evenings?’ If so, what is a typical ‘family home evening’ like?
    </div>
    <div>When I was still at home with my parents and siblings, yes. It started with singing the hymns and a family prayer, and then it could either be watching a specific conference message, playing Boggle, or sharing our talents (playing the piano/guitar, singing, etc).

        If with my husband, no.
        </div>
    <div class="question">Does your family pray together? When?</div>
        <div>With parents, yes. Usually dinner and before going to bed because those are the times when everyone’s home.
            With my husband, yes. Before going to bed usually.
        </div>
    <div class="question">How does your family respect each other?</div>
        <div>I guess with the people I hung out with, my parents were not as controlling as other parents.

            My husband is very respectful of my space and the problems I deal with, especially in regard to mental health.
            </div>
    <div class="question">What are wholesome recreational activities that your family does together?</div>
       <div> Watching movies, playing games, and making food.</div>
    <div class="question">How does your culture affect family time? In what ways?</div>
        <div>My family will always do meals together (not lunch though because we’re usually at school or my parents are at work). That’s how it was when we were all still together. Me, my siblings, and my parents all live separately now (due to school or work), so there’s not a lot of opportunities for us to get together. I know my siblings try to keep up with them through video calls and messages,
             but due to past family cultural differences, I don’t do those as much.

       <div> I have lived all over but most recently in Westminster Colorado and Provo Utah.

<div class="question">Does your family do ‘family home evenings?’ If so, what is a typical ‘family home evening’ like?
</div>
<div>Yes, on a typical Monday we would gather the whole family and start with a hymn and a prayer. 
    After we would have a lesson ( whose job it was to prepare the lesson rotated weekly) 
    then we would play some form of game and we had dessert.
    </div>
<div class="question">Does your family pray together? When?</div>
    <div>Yes we have a family prayer 
        in the morning during scripture study every day.
    </div>
<div class="question">How does your family respect each other?</div>
    <div>Most of my family respects each other. 
        There are a few exceptions however for
        the most part we respect each other.
        </div>
<div class="question">What are wholesome recreational activities that your family does together?</div>
   <div> We play board games together and also play card games together.</div>
<div class="question">How does your culture affect family time? In what ways?</div>
    <div>My family will always do meals together (not lunch though because we’re usually at school or my parents are at work). That’s how it was when we were all still together. Me, my siblings, and my parents all live separately now (due to school or work), so there’s not a lot of opportunities for us to get together.

    <p class="last">What I’ve learned through these interviews was that certain 
        family values exists from different parts of the world (even in a 
        religious context). Some of these includes recreational activities 
        that let’s others work together whether that is in board games or 
        cooking, they help the units to work on a common goal. From an LDS 
        perspective, these individuals would have family prayers together however, 
        Dasom and Esther’s family pray at night while Ethan’s family prays in the morning. 
        Time differences in prayers can say a lot of things such as how busy each family might be. 
        The most important part though is that everyone that was interviewed shared their experiences
         and how in line they were with the proclamation. Through prayers, respect, and recreational activities, 
         these are a few of other counsels that the presidency of the church as proclaimed to helping build successful
          marriages and families. This will be something that I will take into consideration when I am
        preparing for my own family, that we can use the proclamation to build a successful marriage and family.</p>
